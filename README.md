# coding-the-matrix

Coding work for the book from [http://codingthematrix.com/](http://codingthematrix.com/). 

While this does have some overlap with the Coursera course, the exercises tend to be more involved. 

Code written using Python 3.5.4 on OSX using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). 

Each chapter's work is setup in a corresponding python package `chapter#`

So to use you would type something like: 

    >>> from chapter0 import dictutil
    >>> [dictutil.row(p, 20) for p in range(15)]
